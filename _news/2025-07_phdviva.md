I am delighted to announce that I have successfully passed my final PhD viva! This milestone marks the culmination of an incredible research journey that began in October 2020. I extend my deepest gratitude to my PhD supervisors, Prof. Youngjun Cho and Prof. Nadia Berthouze, whose guidance and mentorship have been invaluable throughout this journey. I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to my examiners, Prof. Anthony Steed and Prof. Yannick Benezeth, for their thoughtful engagement and constructive feedback. Finally, I am deeply grateful to all the colleagues, friends, and family who have supported me along the wayâ€”this achievement would not have been possible without your encouragement and support.
