I'm a computer vision and deep learning researcher, currently pursuing my PhD at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/). My research explores approaches to develop robust methods for extracting physiological signals from facial videos, that perform reliably in real-world scenarios,  with a particular focus on multidimesional attention mechanisms.

My work bridges theoretical advancements with practical applications, drawing on my experience in developing healthcare AI systems and edge computing solutions. Recently, I've published research on matrix factorization-based multidimensional attention mechanisms for remote physiological sensing (NeurIPS 2024) and contributed to open-source datasets and frameworks to advance research in this domain.

As a Research Associate at UCL, I'm working on photorealistic image synthesis using diffusion models, while also mentoring graduate students on advanced deep learning techniques.

My approach combines technical innovation with pragmatic system design, informed by over a decade of experience in bringing research concepts to deployable solutions across academic and industry settings. I'm passionate about developing technologies that can improve healthcare monitoring through non-invasive and accessible means.

<!-- Jitesh is a deep-learning and computer vision specialist with over a decade of R&D experience in physiological computing, system design, and healthcare technology. He has a strong track record of contributions across industry and academia, particularly in developing innovative solutions that bridge technical research with real-world applications.

Currently, Jitesh is pursuing a PhD at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) at the UCL Interaction Centre ([UCLIC](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/uclic)). His research, supervised by [Prof. Youngjun Cho](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/54637-youngjun-cho) and [Prof. Nadia Berthouze](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/3849-nadia-berthouze), is fully funded by scholarship for international students. He focuses on advancing contactless physiological signal extraction using RGB and thermal infrared imaging, aiming to improve the accuracy of these methods in complex, real-world scenarios.

In addition to his research, Jitesh serves as Research Associate, for which he is actively engaged in collaborative projects with interdisciplinary teams from multiple universities. He also served as Postgraduate Teaching Assistant in the UCL Computer Science Department supporting various course modules.

Beyond academia, Jitesh consults for [Tata Elxsi](https://www.tataelxsi.com/) in their [Healthcare and Life Sciences](https://www.tataelxsi.com/industries/healthcare-and-life-sciences) business unit. During his full-time tenure there, he played dual roles as a system architect and project manager, contributing to several patents and leading research-driven product development in healthcare technology. His roles included technical proposal preparation, strategic planning, and facilitating team upskilling efforts. -->

Some of my recent research publications are highlighted below.

<!-- He also serves as a Solution Architect (consultant) at [Tata Elxsi](https://www.tataelxsi.com/) in the Healthcare and Life Science Business Unit where he offers support for various research and engineering projects. -->

<!-- Academically, he completed undergrad degree with major in <i>Electronics and Communication Engineering</i> at [Nirma University](https://nirmauni.ac.in/), Ahmedabad in 2008 and further graduated with MSc in <i>Cognitive Systems and Interactive Media</i> at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/), Barcelona in 2011. -->
