I'm a PhD researcher in [Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), specializing in robust computer vision and deep learning systems that perform reliably across diverse real-world conditions. My research advances contactless camera-based physiological sensing through novel multidimensional attention mechanisms grounded in non-negative matrix factorization, enabling joint attention computation across spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions.

This work, [published at NeurIPS 2024](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/af1c61e4dd59596f033d826419870602-Abstract-Conference.html), achieved significant improvements in cross-dataset generalization while maintaining computational efficiency—addressing a critical challenge in deploying AI systems beyond controlled laboratory settings. My research spans computer vision, foundational models, physiological computing, and generative AI, with particular focus on architectures that balance robustness with efficiency.

Prior to my PhD, I spent over a decade in healthcare technology, leading AI, R&D, and systems engineering teams to translate research prototypes into commercial products, including FDA/CE-certified medical devices. This experience bridging research and product development informs my approach to tackling technically fascinating challenges while ensuring meaningful societal impact.


<!-- As a Research Associate at UCL, I'm currently exploring photorealistic image synthesis using diffusion models while mentoring graduate students on advanced deep learning techniques. Through my open-source contributions—including widely-adopted datasets and frameworks—I'm committed to advancing the broader AI research community. My work combines rigorous theoretical investigation with pragmatic system design, informed by real-world deployment challenges across computer vision applications. -->

<!-- Jitesh is a deep-learning and computer vision specialist with over a decade of R&D experience in physiological computing, system design, and healthcare technology. He has a strong track record of contributions across industry and academia, particularly in developing innovative solutions that bridge technical research with real-world applications.

Currently, Jitesh is pursuing a PhD at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) at the UCL Interaction Centre ([UCLIC](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/uclic)). His research, supervised by [Prof. Youngjun Cho](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/54637-youngjun-cho) and [Prof. Nadia Berthouze](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/3849-nadia-berthouze), is fully funded by scholarship for international students. He focuses on advancing contactless physiological signal extraction using RGB and thermal infrared imaging, aiming to improve the accuracy of these methods in complex, real-world scenarios.

In addition to his research, Jitesh serves as Research Associate, for which he is actively engaged in collaborative projects with interdisciplinary teams from multiple universities. He also served as Postgraduate Teaching Assistant in the UCL Computer Science Department supporting various course modules.

Beyond academia, Jitesh consults for [Tata Elxsi](https://www.tataelxsi.com/) in their [Healthcare and Life Sciences](https://www.tataelxsi.com/industries/healthcare-and-life-sciences) business unit. During his full-time tenure there, he played dual roles as a system architect and project manager, contributing to several patents and leading research-driven product development in healthcare technology. His roles included technical proposal preparation, strategic planning, and facilitating team upskilling efforts. -->

Some of my recent research publications are highlighted below.

<!-- He also serves as a Solution Architect (consultant) at [Tata Elxsi](https://www.tataelxsi.com/) in the Healthcare and Life Science Business Unit where he offers support for various research and engineering projects. -->

<!-- Academically, he completed undergrad degree with major in <i>Electronics and Communication Engineering</i> at [Nirma University](https://nirmauni.ac.in/), Ahmedabad in 2008 and further graduated with MSc in <i>Cognitive Systems and Interactive Media</i> at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/), Barcelona in 2011. -->
