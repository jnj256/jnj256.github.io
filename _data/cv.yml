        - Thesis Title: Enhancing Out-of-distribution Generalization for Robust Camera-based Remote Physiological Sensing
        - title: Contribution Summary
          contents:
            - Developed a novel multidimensional attention mechanism for an end-to-end learning-based computational pipeline to extract physiological signals from RGB-Thermal facial videos, achieving 5X performance gains on cross-dataset evaluation and state-of-the-art inference latency, while reducing model parameters by 50X, significantly outperforming transformer-based architectures. Additional contributions include a robust semantic segmentation framework for thermal facial images comprising domain-specific data augmentation techniques and multiscale contrastive loss, a real-time signal quality assessment for wearable biosensors, and an rPPG dataset that is now widely used by researchers in remote physiological sensing.
