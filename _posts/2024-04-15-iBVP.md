Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) promises contactless vital sign monitoring across healthcare, human-computer interaction, and wellness applications. Yet a fundamental challenge persists: existing datasets largely neglect ground-truth signal quality assessment, leaving researchers unable to develop algorithms that can reliably distinguish high-quality physiological signals from noise-corrupted data. Our work addresses this gap.

## Dataset Innovation and Technical Specifications

The iBVP dataset directly addresses this critical gap by providing high-resolution signal quality labels alongside comprehensive multi-modal recordings captured across realistic psycho-physiological variations.

### Comprehensive Data Acquisition Protocol

*Figure 2: Experimental setup showing synchronized RGB-thermal acquisition at 1m distance with ear-based PPG ground truth collection across four distinct psycho-physiological conditions.*

The data acquisition protocol induces realistic variations through four carefully designed conditions:

- **Condition A**: Rhythmic slow breathing and rest (baseline physiological state)
- **Condition B**: Easy math task (mild cognitive load)  
- **Condition C**: Difficult math task (high cognitive stress)
- **Condition D**: Guided head movement (motion artifact challenges)

This protocol ensures comprehensive coverage of real-world variations in both physiological states and motion artifacts that rPPG systems must handle in practical deployments.

### Signal Quality Labeling

The dataset provides **dual signal quality assessment**:

**Manual Quality Labels (SQ1, SQ2)**:

- Expert-annotated quality scores (labelled for every 0.5 second segment, extrapolated as per-sample label)
- Ground truth for quality assessment algorithms

**SQA-PhysMD Automated Labels**:

- Dense per-sample quality scores  
- Trained and validated quality assessment model

This dual approach enables both algorithm development and validation for signal quality assessment—a critical capability missing from existing datasets.
